This is a simple, generic landing page. ðŸ›¬

This project can act as a template for more customized page. You can add a logo, content, images, change the colors and styles... to match your brand or the thing you are building a webiste for. 

To build it I went section by section, adding first the basic structure with HTML and then styling it with CSS before moving on to the next section. That way everything looks the way you want right away and less unexpected things happen in the end, plus, a lot of structures and styles repeat later on so you can recycle them and improve the workflow.

I tried to keep the code as minimalistic as possible and make it follow a theme that hopefully makes sense to external readers. There are also comments for every section so you can quickly know where you are.

This project was a good test of the use of divs and flexbox and correctly using and targeting classes and tags. It was also a good test of discipline and good habits as I tried to commit often, which forced me to think deeper about the code and the general conceptual idea of what I was trying to build before actually reaching for the keyboard. It also tested my OCD cause I had to fight not to make everything pixel-perfect.
